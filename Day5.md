## Goals

* Go throught the document [State of GPT](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zmEGzm1cdXupNoqZ65h7yg) and figure out the key problems.
* Make the pratical pretrain experiment plan for a personal environmnent.
* Understand the SOTA Stable diffusion model.
* How PPO integrated with the LLM training process.
* Try and successfull use Midjourney

##  Details

* Stat of GPT
    *  Ask for relection, LLMs can often recoginize later when their samples didn't seem to have worked out well
    * LLMs don't want to succeed??? If you want to scucceed, and you should ask for it.


* Understand the Stable Diffusion
    * forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise to the input image xâ‚€ step by step, a reference about adding normal [numpy random normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html)
